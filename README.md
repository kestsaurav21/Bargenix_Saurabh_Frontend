# Chatbot Web Application (Static UI)

A simple, responsive chatbot web application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. This is a static user interface (UI) that simulates a chatbot interaction without any backend functionality.

## Features

- **Chatbot UI**: A clean and modern chatbot interface where users can interact with the bot.
- **Responsive Design**: The chatbot and page are fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
- **Chatbox Toggle**: A floating chat logo button allows users to open or close the chatbox.
- **Auto-Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls to the bottom of the chat window as new messages are added.
- **Close Chatbox**: A close button inside the chatbox lets users easily hide it when not in use.
